### Scope of the project:
We can define the scope of the project on three pillars: 
* Sensor modeling, camera-based pose estimation, and fusion with Kalman filter
* Setting up the dynamics/trajectory of the rocket
* Blender environment and python sim

The primary part of the project would be setting up the pose estimation, as that is the focus of the class. The other two points are auxillary but required to make the pose estimation work. 
There are also reach goals:
* Implement it in closed-loop with guidance and control. 
* Implement it on hardware (quadcopter in flightroom)

Task delegation for week 1:
* Anshuk: Start setting up sim in blender environment and the python API. Start overleaf + project structure diagram.
* Yuji: Start lit review and also get involved in blender sim with Anshuk. Help Kris with dynamics setup.
* Faress: Lit review for camera-based pose estimation, find useful material/papers.
* Kris: Set up dynamic model, and start formulating the set trajectory.
